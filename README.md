# Buds ðŸŒ¸

**Buds** are modular, reusable firmware components designed to be plugged into **Shoots** â€” the firmware that powers **Sprout**â„¢ hardware modules. Think of them as sonic building blocks: small DSP tools, behaviors, or algorithms.

> A Shoot might bloom with many Buds â€” each one adding its own color and function.

A Bud is a self-contained code unit that implements a specific function:
- A waveform generator
- A modulation type
- A filter
- A control mapping
- A UI/LED behavior
- A DSP utility

They can be added to Shoots to extend their features, or used to build entirely new ones.
